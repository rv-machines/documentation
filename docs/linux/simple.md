# Linux on RISC-V using QEMU and BUSYBOX from scratch

## Abstract

This guide will show you the steps of building from scratch, using `QEMU` and `Busybox`, a minimal Linux targeting the `RISC-V` architecture.

This is an updated guide from [Running 64- and 32-bit RISC-V Linux on QEMU](https://risc-v-getting-started-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linux-qemu.html).

## Introduction

The aim is to cross-compile the `Linux` image along with `Busybox` from the `X86_64` CPU architecture to the `RISC-V` arch and start a virtual machine with `QEMU` that will use them.

## Environment

This guide has been tested on `Fedora 33` in February 2021.

## Linux

### Install

We can easily compile `Linux` using a ready-to-go *toolchain* provided by your distro :

=== "RHEL"
    ``` bash
    sudo dnf install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu
    ```

=== "Debian"
    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu
    ```

> Cross-build GNU C compiler.
Only building kernels is currently supported.  Support for cross-building
user space programs is not currently provided as that would massively multiply
the number of packages.

### Pull

Let's fetch `Linux` from *Linus Torvald's* repository [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
```

Now fetch the last stable revision :

``` bash
git checkout v5.11 # as of February 2021
```

### Configure

In order to find the **prefix** of your installed toolchain from the command above, you can use :

``` bash
PREFIX=$(rpm -ql gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu | grep "lib/gcc" | cut -d'/' -f5 | head -n1)
```

The following steps require additional tools :

```bash
sudo dnf install flex bison
```

Let's use the default configuration by issuing :

``` bash
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=${PREFIX}- defconfig
```

#### Side notes about the Makefile

``` Makefile
# Cross compiling and selecting different set of gcc/bin-utils
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When performing cross compilation for other architectures ARCH shall be set
# to the target architecture. (See arch/* for the possibilities).
# ARCH can be set during invocation of make:
# make ARCH=ia64
# Another way is to have ARCH set in the environment.
# The default ARCH is the host where make is executed.

# CROSS_COMPILE specify the prefix used for all executables used
# during compilation. Only gcc and related bin-utils executables
# are prefixed with $(CROSS_COMPILE).
# CROSS_COMPILE can be set on the command line
# make CROSS_COMPILE=ia64-linux-
# Alternatively CROSS_COMPILE can be set in the environment.
# Default value for CROSS_COMPILE is not to prefix executables
# Note: Some architectures assign CROSS_COMPILE in their arch/*/Makefile
```

### Compile

Now is the time to bench your CPU by actually compiling `Linux` !

``` bash
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=${PREFIX}- -j $(nproc)
```

At the end of the compilation process you should see a line similar to :

```
Kernel: arch/riscv/boot/Image.gz is ready
```

Congratulation, you have built `Linux` for `RISC-V` !

## Qemu 

We will use `Qemu` for launching `Linux` on our `X86_64` hardware. This is ideal for prototyping in a `RISC-V` without having specific hardware.

> QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

Instead of building it from scratch, we can simply use the one provided by your distro.

=== "RHEL"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo dnf install qemu-system-riscv
    ```

=== "Debian"

    ``` bash
    $
    ```

## Toolchain

As you may have noticed, if you want to build your applications for `RISC-V`, you can't use the previously installed package because it will lack *C libraries* that your program may depend on.

We have to build our own *toolchain* in order to build `Busybox` later in this guide.

This part is heavily inspired by the [README from the RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain project](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/blob/master/README.md). Feel free to follow their instructions or the ones below.

### Pull

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
```

### Install requirements

=== "RHEL"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo dnf install ncurses-devel ncurses autoconf automake python3 libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel gawk texinfo patchutils gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel expat-devel
    ```

=== "Debian"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo apt-get install ncurses-devel ncurses autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev
    ```

### Configure and Install

The command below will compile the toolchain and install the artifacts in `/opt/riscv`.

``` bash
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
sudo make linux -j $(nproc)
```

If you list `/opt/riscv/bin`, you should see an executable file of the name `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc`.

Add `/opt/riscv/bin` to your `PATH`. For example :

``` bash
nano ~/.bash_profile

# User specific environment and startup programs
PATH=$PATH:/opt/riscv/bin
```

#### Side notes

You can change the prefix by passing the `--prefix=$RISCV` option at the configuration stage :

``` bash
./configure --prefix=$RISCV
```

## Busybox

What is `Busybox` ?

To put in a nutshell : 

> BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file.

From : [BusyBox - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox)

`Busybox` will be our *shell* in order to interact with the operating system.

### Pull 

``` bash
git clone https://git.busybox.net/busybox
cd busybox
git checkout 1_32_1
```

### Configure

We configure the build with default settings.

``` bash
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- defconfig
```

In order to simplify this guide, we will build `Busybox` with *static linking*. In order to do so, execute the following command :

``` bash
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- menuconfig
```

Then, in the graphical interface, select with ++space++ :
```
Busybox Settings --->
Build Options --->
Build BusyBox as a static binary (no shared libs) ---> yes
```

Press ++esc++ ++esc++, finally save the configuration (`.config`)


### Compile

``` bash
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- -j $(nproc)
```

## INITRAMFS

Your `Linux` requires a *file system* in order to properly run. So we will prepare the file structure and the `init` script.

``` bash
mkdir initramfs
cd initramfs
mkdir -p {bin,sbin,dev,etc,home,mnt,proc,sys,usr,tmp}
mkdir -p usr/{bin,sbin}
mkdir -p proc/sys/kernel
cd dev
sudo mknod sda b 8 0 
sudo mknod console c 5 1
cd ..
```

### Busybox

Drop the `busybox` executable from the previous section into the filesystem :

``` bash
cp ../busybox/busybox ./bin/
```

### INIT

After the kernel has started, we have to start `Busybox` and finalize the system initialization. We will use a script called `init` that will do the hard work.

``` bash
nano init
```

Put the following content into it :

``` bash
#!/bin/busybox sh

# Make symlinks
/bin/busybox --install -s

# Mount system
mount -t devtmpfs  devtmpfs  /dev
mount -t proc      proc      /proc
mount -t sysfs     sysfs     /sys
mount -t tmpfs     tmpfs     /tmp

# Busybox TTY fix
setsid cttyhack sh

# https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt?h=1_32_stable
echo /sbin/mdev > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
mdev -s

sh
```

Add executable flag :

``` bash
chmod +x init
```

At this stage, your initramfs should look like :

``` bash
[nikita@localhost initramfs]$ tree
.
├── bin
│   └── busybox
├── dev
│   ├── console
│   └── sda
├── etc
├── home
├── init
├── mnt
├── proc
│   └── sys
│       └── kernel
├── sbin
├── sys
├── tmp
└── usr
    ├── bin
    └── sbin
```

Actually create the initramfs :

``` bash
find . -print0 | cpio --null -ov --format=newc | gzip -9 > initramfs.cpio.gz
```

## Runtime

Everything is ready ! Start the virtual machine from the main working directory with :

``` bash
qemu-system-riscv64 -nographic -machine virt \
  -kernel linux/arch/riscv/boot/Image \
  -initrd initramfs/initramfs.cpio.gz \
  -append "console=ttyS0"
```

At this stage, you must have an interactive shell ready :

``` bash
/ # uname -a
Linux (none) 5.11.0 #1 SMP Sun Feb 21 14:07:39 CET 2021 riscv64 GNU/Linux
```

In order to exit the virtual machine, press ++ctrl+a++ then ++x++
